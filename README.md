### Project Description
A computer vision-based fun project that lets you draw on-screen using your nose! Gesture with your hand to start drawing, pause, or quit ‚Äî all hands-free!

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Artists struggle with traditional tools... what if you had to draw only using your nose?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We let you draw by tracking your nose via webcam using MediaPipe FaceMesh and hand gestures. If you raise 3 fingers, you draw. Raise 2 hands? Quit. Raise 1? Clear the canvas.
